	<p>
	Malory Archer is currently head and spymaster of ISIS, International Secret Intellegence Service. In her youth, she 
	was employed by OSS - Office of Strategic Services - and was quickly sent abroad to protect the United States. During 
	this time, she got pregnant by one of four possible men, including Major Nikolai Jakov (Head of the KGB), and famous 
	jazz drummer Buddy Rich. Nine months later, she delivered her son Stirling at a bar in Morocco, where she met 
	Woodhouse.

	Woodhouse would come to raise Stirling for five year, but after that, she came back to raise him. She might not
	have been the perfect mother, oftentimes being emotionally harsh or deceptive to her son, she does love him very 
	much, and gets incredibly protective of her son. At work, she is a powerful woman, with her eyes on everything and 
	everyone, and a drink in her hand. While she may seem scornful of her employees, she does care about their well being.
